-Description of ADODB v4.98 library import into Moodle
+Description of ADODB V5.11 library import into Moodle
+
+This library will be probably removed in Moodle 2.1,
+it is now used only in enrol and auth db plugins.
+The core DML drivers are not using ADODB any more.
 
 Removed:
  * contrib/
  * cute_icons_for_site/
  * docs/
  * pear/
+ * session/
  * tests/
  * server.php
+ * lang/* except en (because they were not in utf8)
 
 Added:
  * index.html - prevent directory browsing on misconfigured servers
  * readme_moodle.txt - this file ;-)
 
 Our changes:
- * adodb-lib.inc.php - added support for "F" and "L" types in  _adodb_column_sql()
- * adodb-lib.inc.php - modify some debug output to be correct XHTML. MDL-12378.
-       Reported to ADOdb at: http://phplens.com/lens/lensforum/msgs.php?id=17133
-       Once fixed by adodb guys, we'll return to their official distro.
- * drivers/adodb-mysqli.inc.php - fixed problem with driver not detecting enums
-       in the MetaColumns() function. MDL-14215.
-       Reported to ADOdb at: http://phplens.com/lens/lensforum/msgs.php?id=17383

- * drivers/adodb-mssql.inc.php, drivers/adodb-oci8.inc.php (qstr) and
-       adodb.inc.php (addq and qstr) - fixed wrong "undo magic quotes" that was
-       ignoring "magic_quotes_sybase" and leading to wrongly escaped contents. MDL-19452

-       we'll return to their official distro.
