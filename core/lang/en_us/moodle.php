<ol>
<li>Fill out the <a href="{$a}">New Account</a> form with your details.</li>
<li>An email will be immediately sent to your email address.</li>
<li>Read your email, and click on the web link it contains.</li>
<li>Your account will be confirmed and you will be logged in.</li>
<li>Now, select the course you want to participate in.</li>

that your teacher has given you. This will "enroll" you in the
course.</li>
<li>You can now access the full course. From now on you will only need
to enter your personal username and password (in the form on this page)
to log in and access any course you have enrolled in.</li>
